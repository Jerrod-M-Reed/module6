I am currently a graduate student at IU Indianapolis and I am pursuing a Masters in Library Science. I currently work at both the Christian Theological Seminary Library by day, and the IU Indy University library by night. I am submitting this assignment way later than should be acceptable, so I will at least try to entertain you!
